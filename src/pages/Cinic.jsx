                Cinic Bike Gear is a small mountain bike start up with ambitions
                to grow big. The brand needed a logo, web and ecommerce platform
                as well as printed material and apparel designs.

              <h3>Logo and Style</h3>
              <p>
                After researching the current mountain biking industries as well
                as a range of action sports such as motocross and skate
                boarding. I designed a number of logo iterations that were
                narrowed down to a single logo type that would be fitting on a
                wide range of products. I also came up with a color pallet that
                could be used online as well as on the first season of apparel.

              <h3>UI/UX</h3>
              <p>
                As a small startup Cinic needed an online store that would be
                give them room for product growth as well as offer the ability
                to become an information hub for the company. I built a custom
                theme for WordPress. I am using a plugin to handle the
                transaction and I have included a blog section that is linked to
                Cinicâ€™s social media for product updates for a one stop
                marketing hub.
